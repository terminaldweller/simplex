# Simplex

A python package that solve linear programming problems using the simplex method.<br/>
Features:<br/>
* The Problem is input into the program by a file containing python expression.<br/>
* Solves both min and max problems(duh!).<br/>
* Uses the big M method to find a basic feasible solution when there are none available in the original program.<br/>
* Handles adding slack variables to convert the problem into standard form.<br/>
* Uses the lexicographic rule to prevent ending up in a loop due to degenerate extreme points.<br/>
* outputs in html.</br>

Run Help to get a list of available commandline options.<br/>
```sh
./test.py --help                                                                                                                                                                             [INSERT] 32mS 0â†µ L3

  --equs EQUS, -e EQUS  the path to the file containing the equations
  --csv CSV, -c CSV     the path to the CSV file containing the problem
  --delim DELIM, -l DELIM
                        the separator for the csv file
  --slack SLACK, -s SLACK
                        slack variable base name, names are cretedby adding a number to the string
  --aux AUX, -a AUX     aux variable base name, names are cretedby adding a number to the string
  --iter ITER, -i ITER  maximum number of iterations
  --min, -m             determines whether its a minimization problem.if not, its a maximization problem
  --verbose, -v         whether to print output verbosely
  --debug, -d           whether to print debug info
  --out, -o             path to the output file
  --numba, -n           whether to print debug info]q
```

Example usage:<br/>
```sh
dsimplex -e ./tests/equ6.py -a xa -v -s z -m
```

## The Equation File
dsimplex currently accepts two input formats:</br>

### Python Expressions
Each equation in the equations file should a valid python expression. There are a couple notes though:<br/>
* For conditions that end in equality you must use `==` instead of `=` to make it a legal python expression.
* Nothing will be evaluated so writing something like `4/5*x1` is illegal. Use `.8*x1` instead.
* You can use comments inside the equations file. They are the same format as the python comments.
* The cost equation is one without a binary comparison operator, e.g. `<=,<,>=,>`.
* The order of the equations in the equations file is not important. You can put them in in any order you want.
As an example:<br/>
```py
# cyclic test
-0.75 * x4 + 20 * x5 - 0.5 * x6 + 6 * x7
x1 + 0.25 * x4 - 8 * x5 - x6 + 9 * x7 == 0
x2 + 0.5 * x4 - 12 * x5 - 0.5 * x6 + 3 * x7 == 0
x3 + x6 == 1
x1 >= 0
x2 >= 0
x3 >= 0
x4 >= 0
x5 >= 0
x6 >= 0
x7 >= 0
```

### CSV
* The order of the equations is not important. It is also not important where the cost function is in the csv file as long as it is there.
* The variables with zero coefficients should be left empty.
